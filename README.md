# td_learning_deepRL

In this project I have implemented the Temporal Difference methods used in reinfocement learning.

I have used Cliff Walking environment from Open AI's gym toolkit. 

Following concepts have been implemented:

SARSA, SARSAMAX(Q-Learning) and Expected SARSA


I have read and used the following resources while completing this project:

**Note - The most I have learned about the RL is from David Silver Lectures. That guy is awesome !
